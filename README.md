# dfply_exploration
Data Scientists spend most of their time cleaning data is a well-known fact.

dfply is a spectacular package for data munging in python which closely resembles the dplyr package in R. I would recommend it to anyone who is comfortable with R and would want to leverage the machine learning packages in python without having to learn the python syntax for data munging.
Please refer to the jupyter notebook for sample dfply codes along with their equivalent dplyr codes
